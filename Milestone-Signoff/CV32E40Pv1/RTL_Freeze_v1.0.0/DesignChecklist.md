## Design Checklist for Functional RTL Freeze
An item is "signed off" once the `Signed-off By` and `Sign-off Date` cells are filled in. `Signed-off By` should be an email address.  If there is an Exception or Waiver, it should be captured as a GitHub issue in core-v-docs and the issue number recorded in the `Exceptions/Waiver/Comment` cell.

| Coding rules     | Module and File names                             | No two modules in the design have the same name. Each module name shall be prefixed with the project name (e.g. cv32e40p_<module>) Each module name shall match the file name using the system verilog suffix ".sv" (e.g. cv32e40p_controller module located in cv32e40p_controller.sv file) Each system verilog file shall contain only one module definition                                                                      | davide@openhwgroup.org | 2020-12-02 | Except for the cv32e40p_register_file who is defined both in the cv3240p_register_file_ff.sv and cv32e40p_register_file_latch.sv file. Only one can be compiled. By default the ff version is selected as reported in the manifest file.    |

| Coding rules     | Low technology dependence                         | In IP designs, technology-specific blocks (mainly RAM cells) are accessible and easily replaced by blocks targetting other ASIC or FPGA technologies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | davide@openhwgroup.org | 2020-12-02 | The cv32e40p_sim_clock_gate.sv does not contain a tech-specific block.
