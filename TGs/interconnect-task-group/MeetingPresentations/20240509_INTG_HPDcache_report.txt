Title of project:
  CV-HPDCACHE

Date of report:
  May 9th, 2024

Summary:
  Development and verification of a High-Performance L1 Dcache integrated with
  the CVA6.

Prepared by:
  Cesar Fuguet

Activities and progress since last report:
  - Achievements:
    - Parametrization implemented: parameters of the HPDcache are now passed
      through a structure parameter during the instantiation. This allows
      having heterogeneous instantiations in the same system (multiple
      instances of the HPDcache with different parameters).

  - Planned:
    - Add the HPDcache in the Thales' CVA6 UVM testbench (in progress)
    - Publish the HPDcache User Guide in the OpenHW ReadTheDocs server
    - Still working in the delivery of a preliminary testplan. Delayed until
      June'24
    - Working in the delivery of a preliminary testbench
    - Develop hybrid write-policy functionality
    - Develop scratchpad mode functionality

  - Unplanned:
