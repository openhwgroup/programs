## Specification Process

### Overview

OpenHW uses a lightweight specification development process to produce specification documents (which are similar to standards documents). Such "specifications" convey, for instance: 
 - Protocol/functionality of an interface to ensure interoperability across the interface
 - Naming convention such as mnemonic for an instruction class
 
This type of specification is developed and frozen in a Task Group designated by the Technical Working Group (TWG) to this task, then ratified and released (published) by TWG.

Note that this process does not refer to a "requirements specification" for an OpenHW Group project such as an open-source Core or Hardware or Software project. In that context, "requirements specification" is a list of the required features of the open-source project.  

### Characteristics of the OpenHW Group Specification Process

### Specification Revision Numbers

OpenHW Group Specifications shall use semantic versioning https://semver.org/ with the Revision in the form vX.Y.Z-postfix
The Revision number is combined with the Specification State (below), for example "v1.0.0-rel1" to indicate both the Revision number and State.



### Specification States and postfix

The ratification or completion State is meant to be written together with the Title and Revision in each OpenHW Group specification so that a reader will be aware of the state of completion of the Specification.
These are the OpenHW Group Specification States and corresponding postfixes:

- â€œIn Development". The version postfix is -devW, for example -dev1, -dev2 
- "In Review" (optional). The version postfix is -reviewW, for example -review1, -review2 
- "Release Candidate". The version postfix is -rcW, for example -rc1, -rc2 
- "Released". The version postfix is -relW, for example -re11, -rel2 

#### "OpenHW Group Specification - In Development"

When the specification is initiated, all drafts will be entitled  "OpenHW Group Specification: Title : vX.Y.Z-devW".
(During initial development of the spec before first release, the Revision number is of the form X.Y.Z with X=0). 

NOTE: if the specific template used for publication would repeat the version number if vX.Y.Z is included as part of the title, it may be omitted, as long as the version number is prominently visible in the specification front matter. 


This state is also used when a released spec is subsequently revised. 

During revision of a released specification, the Revision number increments as appropriate depending on whether the revision is a major or minor update. 

#### "OpenHW Group Specification - In Review"

This state is optional; see the note below.

When the specification is frozen for technical review by a Task Group, all drafts will be entitled "OpenHW Group Specification: Title : vX.Y.Z-reviewW". 
When the TG(s) has completed its review, the reviewed and stable Revision will be relabelled as "rc" - see next section.

See note above about version numbering as part of the title. 

NOTE: This state can be bypassed if a Task Group does not require a review stage. That is, the TG can move the spec from "In Development" to "Release Candidate".


#### "OpenHW Group Specification - Release Candidate"

When the specification is proposed as a candidate for release, drafts will be entitled "OpenHW Group Specification: Title : vX.Y.Z-rcW",

See note above about version numbering as part of the title. 

The Revision number used at this stage would normally be same as the proposed Revision to be released. 

The Release Candidate specification will be notified as open for review to the OpenHW TWG.  
Although technical comments are expected to have been resolved by the TG, comments may still be accepted at this stage.
After a suitable review period, the TWG Chair/Co-Chair will determine that the Specification is ready for ballot. 


#### "OpenHW Group Specification - Released"

When a Release Candidate specification has completed ratification (through a TWG vote), the released copy will be entitled "OpenHW Group Specification: Title : VX.Y.Z-relW".
Revision numbers should be of the form X.Y.Z, normally starting with X=1 as the initially released version.

See note above about version numbering as part of the title. 

The Github commit corresponding to the Released spec will be listed on the Github page of the specification repo together with the "OpenHW Group Specification: Title : VX.Y.Z-relW" string


## File Name for specification

The following file name should be used for the PDF version of the specification file

OpenHW_Group_Specification{title_with_underscores}_vX.Y.Z-postfix.pdf

An example is as follows:

OpenHW_Group_Specification_Core-V_eXtension_interface_(CV-X-IF)v1.0.0-rel1.pdf


## Specification Format

The following sections must be included in the OpenHW Group Specification

### Title

The Title should be of the form "OpenHW Group Specification: Title : vX.Y.Z-postfix"

### Revision History

Prior to release a table of draft revisions should be included, which can include description of content in each draft

Upon release, the Revision History should list only released specification Revisions. That is, intermediate revisions used during development and review don't need to be listed.
The table should include Revision, State, Date, and Description. The Description should include a high level description of the content.
