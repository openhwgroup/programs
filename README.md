# core-v-doc
The documentation for the OpenHW Group's set of CORE-V RISC-V cores.  Much, but not all, of the documentation
here is captured in reStructuredText and is rendered to html using
[Sphinx](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/getting-started-with-sphinx.html).
These documents are viewable using readthedocs, see below.
